# Reporting for ASP.NET WebForms - How to print or export a report without showing a preview

This example demonstrates how to print or export a report in an ASP.NET WebForms application without displaying this report's preview.

![Report Prine or Export Without Preview](Images/screenshot.png)

The report uses one of the **ExportTo...**Â methods to export a report document to the page's **Response**.

To print the report, export it to the PDF format. Then write the PDF stream to the page's **Response** with theÂ **Content-Disposition**Â header set to the "inline" value. The browser's built-in PDF viewer opens the PDF file. An alternative method exports the PDF to a separate iframe. In this case, only the print dialog is displayed.
